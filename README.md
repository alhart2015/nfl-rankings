# nfl-rankings

Demo of an ELO-based rating system for the NFL, implemented in Kotlin.
The project is built with Maven and could be compiled into a jar, but
I found it easiest to interact with the program through a unit test
that calls main(). This was an implementation decision based on the
need to quickly iterate and see results, and the relative lack of a
need to run this as a standalone program or distribute it anywhere.

It's worth pointing out that the ratings themselves aren't fantastic.
The formula could certainly be refined, but the intent of the project
is to demonstrate coding ability and not analytic ability. If it would
be of interest to see a more useful set of results, please reach out
as this can be done.
